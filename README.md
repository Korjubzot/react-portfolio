# Portfolio

This repo holds my first portfolio site as a developer. There's not much need for a readme, necessarily, but for posterity I thought I should have something here.

## Usage

This project is solely frontend. You can clone the repo, cd into it, and use `npm start` to get it running on your local machine.
